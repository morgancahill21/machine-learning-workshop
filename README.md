# machine-learning-workshop
This project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing survey data with multiple-choice responses. It includes a function that transforms columns containing multiple selected options (e.g., favorite music genres, activities, preferences) into a structured list-based format that can be used for clustering and machine-learning analysis.
